# SDRT
Research on datacenter networking where the network topology changes in response to a software scheduler (e.g., optical circuit switches, free-space optics, 60GHz wireless). In particular we look at the interactions and modifications needed up-and-down the network stack for these "Software-defined Reconfigurable Topology" (SDRT) networks.
