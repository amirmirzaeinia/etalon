DOCUMENTATION:
==============

Documentation is available and share/doc.

INSTALLATION:
=============

If you installed this package from an RPM normally, you are done, see
the documentation in share/doc for how to use this software, or skip
to the section below if you are using an initrd.

If you installed this package from a tarball, from an RPM using the
--no-scripts option, or extracted the contents of an RPM with rpm2cpio
then you still need rebuild the kernel modules for your kernel.
Please do the following:

1.  cd into the directory where you installed this software.
2.  Run 'sbin/rebuild.sh'.
3.  Run 'sbin/myri_start_stop start'.


USING DRIVER IN AN INITRD:
==========================

Instructions for putting the kernel driver in a custom initrd:

1. Put a copy of the driver found in <prefix_dir>/sbin into your initrd
   image.

2. Modify your init file to load the .ko kernel module at the appropriate
   place for your configuration.

3. Remember that the default device created is called myri0.  If you
   are using dhcp, you may need to make some small changes to the dhcp
   configuration to use myri0 instead of eth0.

4. Create your initrd, and put it on the boot server and boot your system. 

5. After boot run <prefix_dir>/sbin/myri_create_devs.  Depending on your
   setup, you may need to run myri_create_devs only once if your setup
   retains the /dev/myri* devices across reboots, or on every boot if it
   does not.
